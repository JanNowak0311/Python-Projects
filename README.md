# File Organizer

A simple Python app to organize files by type into subfolders (e.g., .txt to Text, .jpg to Images). Built to practice Python basics like loops and file handling.

## Features
- Organizes .txt files into a "Text" subfolder.
- Organizes .jpg files into an "Images" subfolder.
- Creates subfolders if they don't exist.

## How to Run the Script
- Download the program file.
- Open Command Prompt and go to the directory where the file is located (e.g., `cd downloads`).
- Type `python file-organizer.py`, and it should work.
- If the command doesnâ€™t work, you might need to download or update Python on your computer.
