# File Organizer

A simple Python app to organize files by type into categorized subfolders (e.g., Images, Documents, Videos). Built to practice Python basics like loops and file handling with smart file type detection.

## Features
- Organizes all image types (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.) into an "Images" subfolder.
- Organizes all document types (TXT, PDF, DOCX, ZIP, etc.) into a "Documents" subfolder.
- Organizes all video types (MP4, AVI, etc.) into a "Videos" subfolder.
- Organizes all audio types (MP3, WAV, etc.) into an "Audio" subfolder.
- Places uncategorized files into an "Others" subfolder.
- Uses MIME type detection for accuracy and efficiency.

## How to Run the Script
- Download the program file.
- Open Command Prompt and go to the directory where the file is located (e.g., `cd downloads`).
- Type `python file-organizer.py`, and it should work.
- If the command doesnâ€™t work, you might need to download or update Python on your computer.
